<!-- Project Overview: Character Counter -->

This project is a simple character counter that dynamically tracks the number of typed characters and the remaining characters in a textarea.

<!-- Tools & Technologies Used -->

HTML: Structured the page with a textarea and counters.
CSS: Styled the layout with a modern design and color changes based on character limit.
JavaScript: Managed character count updates in real-time.

<!-- JavaScript Development Approach -->

1. DOM Manipulation: Used document.getElementById to select and update elements dynamically.
2. Event Handling: Listened to the "input" event on the textarea to detect changes.
3. State Management: Tracked the length of the input text and updated counters accordingly.
4. Visual Feedback: Changed the text color when approaching the character limit for better user experience.
5. Efficiency: Called updateCounter() once at the start to ensure the correct initial values.

This approach keeps the code clean, efficient, and user-friendly. ðŸš€
